# Web-Development
This repository contains beginner-friendly web development projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my hands-on learning and understanding of front-end development fundamentals through interactive mini projects:

🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game – A simple and interactive game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets users play against the computer with score tracking.

❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game – A 2-player browser game built using JavaScript logic, complete with a responsive layout and winning logic implementation.

🛒 Amazon Clone (UI only) – A static front-end clone of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, responsiveness, and design elements.

These projects demonstrate my grasp of core web technologies and my progress in building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces.
